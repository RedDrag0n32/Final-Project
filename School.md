# School

I am an **IT** major at Mizzou. I just made the switch last semester and so far I am loving it. 
I switched from **CS** to IT because IT gave me more freedom to try different fields that I am interested in and IT gets me ready for the real world.
I am thinking right now that I want to go into video game development. I love video games so being a part of that industry would be a great job to have as an adult. 
I am also really into software development. I love to write code and so far my **favorite** language is **C#**!
